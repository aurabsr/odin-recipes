   <h4>Tiramisu Origin</h4>
   <p>Tiramisu has Italian origins. The famous Italian restaurateur Ado Campeol is credited with its invention in the 1970s. In fact, he was widely known as "the father of tiramisu." The word "tiramisu" translates to "pick-me-up."</p>
    
    <h4>Tiramisu Pronunciation</h4>

    <h4>Does Tiramisu Have Alcohol?</h4>
    <p>Usually contains alcohol. Marsala wine is the traditional choice, but this recipe calls for a mixture of strong coffee and rum. If you prefer not to use alcohol, just leave it out. It will still be delicious with just the coffee alone (just make sure the coffee is extra strong).</p>
    
    <h4>Tiramisu Ingredients</h4>
    <p>Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated tiramisu recipe:</p>
    
    <p><h5>Egg Yolks:</h5> Egg yolks are essential for a thick, rich, velvety smooth filling. Though some traditional recipes use raw eggs, this one doesn't — raw eggs carry the risk of food-borne illness.
    <h5>Sugar:</h5> White sugar is cooked with egg yolks and combined with mascarpone to create a sweet, creamy filling.
    <h5>Milk:</h5> Whole milk slightly thins the thick filling, resulting in a spreadable texture.
    <h5>Cream:</h5> Beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form to create an irresistible whipped cream.
    <h5>Vanilla extract</h5> adds subtle flavor to the homemade whipped cream.
    <h5>Mascarpone:</h5>  Mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a smooth texture and fresh taste, is a key ingredient in classic tiramisu.
    <h5>Coffee:</h5>  Ladyfingers are soaked in strong, spiked coffee — this is what gives tiramisu its signature flavor.
    <h5>Rum:</h5>  Rum is used to spike the coffee that will be drizzled over the ladyfingers. Some Allrecipes community members say they prefer Kahlua.
    <h5>Ladyfingers:</h5>  Ladyfingers are small sponge cakes that are shaped like thick fingers. If you can't find ladyfingers at your grocery store, you can use pound cake cut into strips.
    <h5>Cocoa Powder:</h5>  Finish off this decadent dessert with a generous dusting of cocoa powder.

    <h4>Make the Filling:</h4> <p>Cook the egg yolks, sugar, and milk until slightly thickened. Let cool slightly, then chill in the fridge for about an hour. When the filling has fully chilled, mix in mascarpone cheese.

    Soak the Ladyfingers: Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Pour mixture over ladyfingers that have been split in half lengthwise.
    Assemble the Tiramisu: Line the bottom of a baking dish with soaked ladyfingers. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then half of the whipped cream over that. Repeat in the same order. Dust with cocoa powder.
    How to Store Tiramisu
    Tiramisu is served chilled, so refrigerate the dessert (as well as any leftovers) immediately. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days.</p>
    
    <h4>Can You Freeze Tiramisu?</h4>
    Yes, you can absolutely freeze tiramisu. Wrap the tiramisu in a layer of plastic wrap and then a layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight.
    
   <h4>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h4>
    "I followed the instructions and I got a delicious tiramisu cake," raves giginium. "I followed the recommendations left by one of the reviewers and left the cake in the fridge for one night before eating it. The rum soaked through the ladyfingers and the flavor was wonderful."
    
    "I live in a rather small town, over an hour drive to a grocery store that sells mascarpone and ladyfingers," says Tami. "So I made the substitute mascarpone (found on this website) and used pound cake cut into ¼-inch slices and it still turned out WONDERFUL!"
    
    "This is my absolute favorite, tried-and-true recipe for tiramisu," according to Allie Kate Paterson. "It is better-than-restaurant quality and so easy to make! The hardest part about making it is keeping your hands off of it while it sets in the fridge. The only tweak I make to this recipe is using Kahlua instead of plain rum."
